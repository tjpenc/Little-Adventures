# Little Adventures
## Overview
    This app was created to help users organize their adventures and findings on those adventures to keep track of where they have been and what they have discovered. As well, a user can share their findings in a public section, so others can see what else there is to explore. From a technical aspect, this project was created to demonstrate basic CRUD in a react app and become more comfortable with react hooks. Also, learning how to let users upload photos from their personal computers and integrate the Google Maps API were stretch goals.
